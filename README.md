- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio code, 1.54.3

## Results
Ultimately, the analysis revealed that:
- There were a total of 369,711 votes cast in the election
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The results for each candidate were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% of the vote (85,213 votes received)
    - Diana DeGette: 73.8% of the vote (272,892 votes received)

## Challenge Election Audit Overview

### Purpose
For this challenge, the python code that was used to find the election result information requested by the Colorado Board of Elections in the Project Overview section above was updated to find, output, and record in the [election_analysis](https://github.com/HannaKim4673/Election_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/election_analysis.txt) text file 3 new pieces of information:
- each county's voter turnout
- the percentage of votes for each county
- identification of the county with the highest voter turnout
